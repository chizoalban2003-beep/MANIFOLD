### Added
- `manifold_physical/bridges/roomba_bridge.py` — `RoombaBridge`: iRobot Roomba
  governed by MANIFOLD via iRobot REST cloud API. Command poller (every 20 s),
  sensor poller (every 5 s), bump → obstacle event, `mock_mode` for hardware-free
  testing.
- `manifold_physical/bridges/mqtt_bridge.py` — `MQTTBridge`: any MQTT 3.1.1 IoT
  device as a governed MANIFOLD agent. Minimal MQTT client using stdlib `socket`
  + `struct` only (zero external deps). `DeviceMapping` dataclass,
  `HomeAssistantProfile` classmethod for Home Assistant topics.
- `manifold_physical/camera_detector.py` — `CameraDetector`: YOLOv8 real-time
  obstacle detection to CRNA grid. Graceful fallback to motion-detection-only
  mode when `ultralytics` is not installed. `CameraRegistry` singleton.
  `RaspberryPiConfig` classmethod for Pi 5.
- `manifold_physical/physical_manager.py` — `PhysicalManager`: unified physical
  layer manager. `start_all()`, `stop_all()`, `status()`. Initialises from a
  config dict.

  shape.
- `POST /physical/init` — initialise `PhysicalManager` from request body config.
- `GET /physical/cameras` — `CameraRegistry` status list.
- `manifold_physical/config_example.json` — complete home config (Roomba + MQTT +
  camera).
- `manifold_physical/QUICKSTART.md` — step-by-step guide for first physical
  deployment (Roomba, Home Assistant, webcam).
- 16 new tests across `test_roomba_bridge.py`, `test_mqtt_bridge.py`,
  `test_camera_detector.py`, `test_physical_integration.py`.
- Full `mock_mode` support — all bridges testable without hardware.

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.8.0 in `manifold/__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`.
- `manifold_physical/__init__.py` exports `RoombaBridgeFull`, `MQTTBridge`,
  `DeviceMapping`, `CameraDetector`, `CameraRegistry`, `Detection`,
  `get_camera_registry`, `PhysicalManager`.
- `pyproject.toml`: added `manifold_physical.bridges` to `packages`.

  - All buildings with 5 visual levels: domain houses (multi-floor, windows, flags, torches,
    satellite structures, domain symbols), calibrator (spinning gear, exhaust pipes, energy rings),
    MANIFOLD tower (orb, buttresses, orbiting crystals), defence buildings (antenna, radar, rings, gem)
  - 6 fully animated agents: walk cycles, thought bubbles, progress bars, motion trails, level stars,
    path lines, selection rings, domain-bounded wandering, task assignment, work, return-home cycle
  - Particle system: harvest coins, completion stars, levelup sparks, breach fragments

## [1.5.8] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- MANIFOLD World is now functionally built like Clash of Clans.
  Every building serves a real governance function. Economy is
  interconnected. Time is real. Consequences are real.
- World State Engine: persistent localStorage state (manifold_world_state)
  for all buildings, resources, agents, upgrades. Auto-saved every 10s.
- Tower Levels (1-5): gates agent count, zones, calibrators, heroes.
- Real resource economy: 5 token types (finance_tokens, compute_credits,
  compliance_tokens, audit_credits, manifold_energy), finite pools,
  generation rates scale with building level, depletion throttles agents.
- Calibrator (The Builder): one upgrade at a time, real countdown timers
  shown above building, scaffolding animation while upgrading, speed-up
  with manifold_energy.
- Upgrade system: domain houses and tower upgradeable with costs and timers.
  Building tap panel shows cost/time/progress and speed-up option.
- Defence Buildings: 4 functional buildings with real detection ranges —
  Inject Detector (injection, red), Anomaly Tower (degradation, amber),
  Gossip Relay (poisoning, purple), Honeypot (one-use trap, green).
- Attack system: adversarial attacks spawn at map edges, move toward tower,
  get intercepted by defences matching their type. Breach costs 50 domain
  tokens and drains that zone's agents.
- Agent Training: warmup periods tracked in WS state, level-up queue,
  hero agents (Claude, GPT-4o) with energy bars unlocked at Tower level 4.
- Base Layout Editor: toggle edit mode to drag-and-drop defence buildings,
  with real-time range preview and overlap highlighting.
- Full economy loop: tasks→domain resources, defence→manifold_energy,
  world_health→governance quality, tower_level→zone activation.
- Economy summary panel: tap centre to see income/expense/net rates.
- Web Audio sound effects for harvest, upgrade, attack, breach events.

## [1.5.7] — 2026-05-08

### Added

  HUD resource bars with amber warning at <20%, harvest mechanic (click dome when >=80%),
  agent speed throttle when pool hits 0, floating harvest text, calibration signal to server.
- Agent levelling: health score maps to level 1-5, coloured star indicators above head
  (gold/silver/bronze/grey), zone access rules, level-up particle burst + floater text.
- Agent moods: health score drives speed, bob amplitude, colour brightness, head droop,
  stressed "!" indicator, sparkle particles at >85% health; mood bar in agent tap panel.
- Defence events: 4-phase adversarial probe sequence (shockwave, agents flee home,
  multi-beam governance fire, all-clear); automatic demo timer every 45-90s;
  triggered by WS governance_event with risk_score > 0.88 + refuse action.
- Risk weather system: ambient risk level from agent scores drives visual overlays —
  amber haze (medium), drifting storm clouds (high), lightning flashes (critical).
- The escalation moment: world freezes, dim overlay, MANIFOLD tower fires beam upward,
  decision card appears (Approve / Reject), world resumes with outcome applied.
  Demo timer every 90-150s; WebSocket escalate action also triggers it.
- Memory landscape: completed tasks spawn persistent crystals in localStorage (max 200),
  age-based alpha, tap to show label/timestamp tooltip, forms visual history over time.
- Social links: co-occurrence tracking between busy agents, dotted lines drawn between
  connected pairs (alpha scales with count), red for paused pairs, solid when collaborating,
  connections section in agent tap panel.
- Base growth: building levels 1-5 in localStorage keyed by domain task counts
  (5/15/35/75 tasks), visual upgrades per level (extra floor, roof, windows, flag, outpost),
  level-up construction animation with floater text.
- Achievement system: 8 governance milestones checked after every significant event,
  slide-in toast notification with icon, full achievement grid in MANIFOLD tower panel.
- World growth decoration: corner posts at level 4+, animated waving zone flags at level 5.
- Polish: camera lerp (smooth pan to events), ambient particles per zone (floating upward),
  particle bursts on task completion + level-up, floater texts, haptics on mobile
  (vibrate API for task complete / escalation / defence), Web Audio beep on task complete.

  resource nodes, defence sensors, task pillars, the MANIFOLD tower.
  Touch controls (pan, pinch-zoom) for mobile.
  WebSocket live connection to MANIFOLD server.
  Task deployment by tapping domain zones.
  Agent levelling, resource harvesting, escalation alerts.
  Mini-map overview. PWA manifest for mobile install.
- GET /world serves the game world from the MANIFOLD server
- GET /world/manifest.json serves the PWA manifest
- GET /ws WebSocket endpoint for real-time world updates
  Sends agent_update (every 5s), world_stats (every 30s), governance events.

  Register, heartbeat, pause, resume, health scoring, stale detection.
- manifold/monitor.py — AgentMonitor background loop
  Proactively marks stale agents, detects unhealthy agents, logs events.
- manifold/task_router.py — TaskRouter for arbitrary task intake
  Decomposes complex problems into governed sub-tasks.
  Routes each to the best available registered agent.

  POST /task                    submit any problem for governed routing
- 26 new tests. Total: 2305 passing.

### What this enables
MANIFOLD can now:
  1. Know which agents are running at any moment
  2. Proactively detect stale or unhealthy agents
  3. Pause or redirect a running agent via API
  4. Receive any complex problem, decompose it into sub-tasks,
     govern each sub-task, and route to the best available agent
  This is Mode 3: MANIFOLD as active manager, not just traffic light.
